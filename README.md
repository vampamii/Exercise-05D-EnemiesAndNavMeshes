# Project 05- FPS Maze

When I first played the maze on Exercise 05d I thought it looked unsettling. I tried to use the fact that I am not that familiar with 3D yet, to use the simple and ugly looking place to
feel like a lucid dream. It is kind of inspired by the backrooms aesthetic. I am not sure if it worked, but at least I tried.
